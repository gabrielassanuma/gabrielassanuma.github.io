      <h2>Support Hellfire Club and become our partner</h2>
      <p>Hellfire Club is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1986 in Hawkings by
      vocalist/guitarist Eddie Munson and drummer Dustin. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship
      made them one of the most viewed youtube videos in 2022.<br>
      We are about to release our 1st album of brand new material and We are asking for your help to make our dreams come true.<br>
      We have big plans for promotion and touring, but We have some significant expenses
      (videos, marketing and a downpayment on a van to tour in). More than funding our band, you will <b>become a Hellfire's partner!</b>
      For every donation over 50Usd you will <b>receive a HellfireToken</b> that allows you to claim our high definition songs, exclusive
      content of our tour and as soon Hellfire sign our first contract We will deposit 20% of contract
      value on HellfireToken.</p>
